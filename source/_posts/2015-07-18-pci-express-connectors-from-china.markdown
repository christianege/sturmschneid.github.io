After my decision to build a full [Open Source Software based DVB-S2 USB module](/blog/2015/07/04/full-open-source-dvb-s2-board/) I ordered some PCI-Express connectors from [China on Aliexpress](http://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/A6qjiaIUr?af=704840420). The delivery time was quite low I received my package about 11 days after placing my order. This is really quick for standard delivery from China to Germany. Next step will be adding this connector to [Eagle PCB Design Software](http://www.cadsoft.de/). And designing a small breadboard to PCI-Express board and host it on [OSHPark](https://oshpark.com/).

I have not found any data sheet for this connector yet. On one side it has an engraving with [,,tyco/Electronics''](http://www.te.com) and on the other side some code ,,08306ED''. 

## Update 

After some research I found a ,,data sheet'' [ENG_DS_4-1773442-7_0308-2.pdf](http://www.te.com/usa-en/product-4-1775800-2.html) but it lacks detailed drawings about the PIN pitch. After some research I discovered that those connectors are described in the [PCI Express Card Electromechanical Specification](https://www.google.com/search?q=PCI+Express+Card+Electromechanical+Specification).
